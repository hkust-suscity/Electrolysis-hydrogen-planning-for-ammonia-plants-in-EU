# Hydrogen paper sample Github page

This is the official code repository for the paper (cite name paper) in preparation for submission.

In this paper we study the decarbonization of the European ammonia sector through the substitution of gray hydrogen with green hydrogen produced in-loco.

The model is developed using Python 3.9.12 in the JupyterLab 3.3.2 environment.

### 1. Content
The repository is divided into two folders:
- 'Code_hydrogen_paper.ipynb' containts the sample-code, simplified version of the version used to obtain the main result in the published article. 
- (cita) containts instead the sample-datasets to run the code. (cita) (explain EMHIRES and the table)

Lastly, the document (METADATA) presents all the information required to undestand the key parameters of the model.


### 2. Contacts
For any queries or feedback contact Stefano Mingolla: smingolla@connect.ust.hk or smingolla@ethz.ch. 

### 3. Data Availability

The code and datasets provided are simplified version of the material used in the article (mention). The purpose of the sample code is to highlight the mechanisms of the developed model.
